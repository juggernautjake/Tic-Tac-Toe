<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


In this project I created a tictactoe game that tracks users' in-game selections as well as whose turn it is.<br> 
The game also succesfully recognizes when one of the players meets the win condition.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
<details> <summary>Let user choose board theme</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Create at least two different styles that apply colors, textures, and other styling methods to the elements within the program.</li>
    <li>Then create a button for each of the styles/themes at the very bottom of the window.</li>
    <li>When one of the buttons is clicked, implement a function that will apply the selected style to all of the elements shown.</li>
  </ol>
</details>
<details> <summary>Don't allow users to override previously selected sections of the board. <br> 
  Once a section of the board has been chosen, it shouldn't continue to be a selectable option.</summary></details>
<details> <summary>Trigger an alert when the win condisiton has been met</summary> </details>
<details> <summary>Give the players an option to reset the board for a new game</summary> </details>
